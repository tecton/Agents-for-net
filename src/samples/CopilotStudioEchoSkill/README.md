# Microsoft Copilot Studio Skill Sample

This is a sample of a simple conversational Agent that can be used from the Microsoft Copilot Studio Skills feature.

This sample is intended to introduce you to:
- The basic operation of the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK messaging handling.
- Requirements of a conversational Agent being used by another bot.
- Using this Agent from Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## Basic concepts
- A Skill is an Agent.  There is nothing inherently different from other Agents.
- While many Agents are conversational, they can respond to any messages sent using the Activity Protocol.
- Conversations are multi-turn interactions, including possibly a large number of exchanges with the user until the conversation is complete.  
- Agents being called by another Agent are expected to:
  - Indicate when the conversation is over, with a "success" result and optional return value.
  - Indicate the conversation is over after a critical error.
- Microsoft Copilot Studio requires a manifest that describes the Agent capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) version 8.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows)

## Using this Agent from Microsoft Copilot Studio as a Skill

- In order to use this sample from Copilot Studio, the bot will need to be created on Azure, and authentication setup.
  - It is possible to run the Agent locally for debugging purposes.  
  - Managed Identity does not work locally so `ClientSecret` or `Certificate` will need to be used.
  - A tunnel will be required to route messages sent to the bot to you locally running agent.
- Copilot Studio requires a manifest for the agent ("Skills Manifest").  This is discussed below.

1. [Create an Azure Bot](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot)
   - Record the Application ID, the Tenant ID, and the Client Secret for use below

1. Configuring the token connection in the Agent settings
   > The instructions for this sample are for a SingleTenant Azure Bot using ClientSecrets.  The token connection configuration will vary if a different type of Azure Bot was configured.  For more information see [DotNet MSAL Authentication provider](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-DotNetMSALAuth)

   1. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the sample project.

   1. Find the section labeled `Connections`,  it should appear similar to this:

      ```json
      "Audiences": [
        "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" // this is the Client ID used for the Azure Bot
      ],

      "Connections": {
          "BotServiceConnection": {
          "Assembly": "Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal",
          "Type":  "MsalAuth",
          "Settings": {
              "AuthType": "ClientSecret", // this is the AuthType for the connection, valid values can be found in Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal.Model.AuthTypes.  The default is ClientSecret.
              "AuthorityEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{TenantId}}",
              "ClientId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client ID used for the connection.
              "ClientSecret": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client Secret used for the connection.
              "Scopes": [
                "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
              ],
              "TenantId": "{{TenantId}}" // This is the Tenant ID used for the Connection. 
          }
      }
      ```

      1. Set the **ClientId** to the AppId of the bot identity.
      1. Set the **ClientSecret** to the Secret that was created for your identity.
      1. Set the **TenantId** to the Tenant Id where your application is registered.
      1. Set the **Audience** to the AppId of the bot identity.
      
      > Storing sensitive values in appsettings is not recommend.  Follow [AspNet Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-9.0) for best practices.

1. Updating the Agent Manifest
   - Open the [sample manifest](./wwwroot/manifest/echoskill-manifest-1.0.json)
   - Update the `privacyUrl`, `iconUrl`, `msAppId`, and `endpointUrl`
   - If you are running the bot locally, this will be `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`
   - Once EchoSkill is started, the manifest is available via a GET to `{host-or-tunnel-url}/manifest/echoskill-manifest-1.0.json`

1. Run `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:
   > NOTE: Go to your project directory and open the `./Properties/launchSettings.json` file. Check the port number and use that port number in the devtunnel command (instead of 3978).

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

1. Start the Agent in Visual Studio

### Using EchoSkill in Copilot Studio
- In order to use an Agent from Copilot Studio Skills
  - The Azure Bot and Identity must have been created on Azure
  - If the bot is running locally, the "Messaging Endpoint" on the Azure Bot must be set to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`
  - On the App Registration on Azure, the "Home page URL" should be set to the App Service URL (or the Tunnel URL)
- Create a new, or open an existing, Copilot Studio Agent
- Go to Agent **Settings**
- Select **Skills** on the left sidebar
- Select **Add a Skill**
- Enter the URL to the skill manifest, for example `{host-or-tunnel-url}/manifest/echoskill-manifest-1.0.json`
- Click **Save** when validation is complete.
- From any Topic, add a new **Call an Action** node, and select "Echo messages from user"
- Test the agent in Copilot Studio.
