# Microsoft 365 Agents SDK - C# /.NET

The Microsoft 365 Agent SDK simplifies building full stack, multichannel, trusted agents for platforms including M365, Teams, Copilot Studio, and Webchat. We also offer integrations with 3rd parties such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, or Twilio. The SDK provides developers with the building blocks to create agents that handle user interactions, orchestrate requests, reason responses, and collaborate with other agents.

The M365 Agent SDK is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade agents, enabling developers to integrate components from the Azure AI Foundry SDK, Semantic Kernel, as well as AI components from other vendors.

## Current Project State is PUBLIC PREVIEW

We are in preview with this codebase right now.

**PREVIEW means:**

- **Do not use this code in a production environment or for production purposes.**
- Things are not yet stable and while we try hard to not break things, **we will break them** from time to time as we evolve this code base. Please be as  patient with us as possible.
- We are still revising things in this code base and reorganizing it.
- We may Add or Remove Features and capabilities from this code base during Preview.

## Using this code

The best way to consume this SDK is via our Nuget packages found here: [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/nugetbotbuilder). They will all begin with **Microsoft.Agents**
